# @mdarrik/11ty-simple-starter-sass

This is a really bare-bones starter using Sass. This uses the [11ty data cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/) & Sass's JS API to generate your CSS. This gives a bit more control of where your CSS can end up, (inlined or separate files with permalink), and means that you don't necessarily need 3rd party tools like [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all).
